Talib, Rosli
I still struggling to get networker server been monitor by DPA server

17:18
Skilbeck, Michael
it works fine on my build
i am using b136
but in b139 this doesn't work
i am going to login to machine and see server.log

17:19
Talib, Rosli
what's the step to make it been monitor? 

17:19
Skilbeck, Michael
also only shows one backup application being monitored
add in disc wizrd

17:20
Talib, Rosli
ok

17:20
Skilbeck, Michael
with remote agent set to dpa server agent
discovery wizard doesn't complete 
properly

17:21
Skilbeck, Michael
i am trying to share desktop
can you see the disc wzd

17:23
Skilbeck, Michael
can you see disc wizard
finish is greyed out but wizard doesn't close

17:23
Talib, Rosli
ok

17:24
Skilbeck, Michael
only one backup application is shown
from elaines list there should be lots
because the hosts have been created
but the applications have not or aren't being displayed
will need to check in db
and the data collection policy doesn't show requests being assigned
if requests aren't assigned no data can be collected
this is very slow
this seems ok
anyway I am going to login to machine and have a look

17:29
Talib, Rosli
ok... I missed the data collection steps and request 

17:29
Skilbeck, Michael
well they are assigned to w2k8x64nw762
so need to understand what is going wrong with wcu-nwsuse10.lss.emc.com

17:32
Talib, Rosli
is it support networker 8? because networker client I hv is rhel55-networker (I can see in Elaine server just now) and rhel58-nw8 (networker 8)

17:33
Skilbeck, Michael
we haven'ttested nw8 yet
will be in 5.8.3
but we are going on assumption that it should work without changes

17:35
Talib, Rosli
ok, thanks Mike... I'm going to make it been monitor first.. that's the important one...
will ping you if I hv problem

17:36
Skilbeck, Michael
ok
