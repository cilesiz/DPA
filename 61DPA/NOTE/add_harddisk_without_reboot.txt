1) fdisk -l

- Shows only the existing disks, there is no sign of the new one.

2) What we need to do is, re-scan the SCSI bus, without rebooting the vm. To do this run the following command:

	echo "- - -" >/sys/class/scsi_host/host#/scan

	Where the # is replaced with the SCSI host value, usually 0

3) Now we re-run the command:

	fdisk -l

- We can now see our additional disk and can carry on configuring it using the usual tools, I.e. fdisk and mkfs or partitioner through yast, etc
