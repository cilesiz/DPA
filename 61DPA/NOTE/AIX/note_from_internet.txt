Martin, Make sure that your dsm.sys is properly configured. I have been using the client access daemon with good results - dsmcad



&lt;dsm.sys>

passwordaccess = generate * To get rid of your tsm login problem

pasworddir = /tsm/password/dir

managed services = schedule

tcpclientaddress = dns.client.name * or the client IP address

tcpclientport = 1502 *I think this is default to get rid of the port number issue



&lt;rc script>

case "$1" in

"start")

echo "starting TSM daemon"

cd /usr/tivoli/tsm/client/ba/bin

/usr/tivoli/tsm/client/ba/bin/dsmcad &amp; >/dev/null 2>&amp;1

;;

"stop")

echo "stopping TSM daemon"

kill `ps -e -o "%p %c" | awk '/dsmcad/ {print $1}'`

;;

esac



cheers,
