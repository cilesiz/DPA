Step1
=====
1) Run Discover a EMC FileStorage (Celerra) test using remote agent
- discover object manually
- Name = uncle-mgmt.wysdm.lab.emc.com 
- Credential = dpa / serverg0d (create new one if not exist - this is uncle-mgmt's credential)
2) Start Test = should successfull
3) press "<Back" button and change to local agent and some other details (valid details)
4) Start Test = should successfull
5) Object should be created

Expected
--------
Host should be created

Step2
=====
Check effective request REST API (won't be visible from UI)
- URIs = 
/dpa-api/nodes/{nodeid}/datacollectionpolicy/all-requests
/dpa-api/nodes/{nodeid}/datacollectionpolicy/applicable-requests
/dpa-api/nodes/{nodeid}/datacollectionpolicy/valid-requests

Expected
--------
- Need to ensure only the requests which were assigned as per DCP are assigned
- all gave OK result

Step3
=====

Check DB table (using PGAdmin or "dpa ds query" )
-QUERY=
"select * from dpa.request_default;"
"select * from dpa.request_option_default;"
"select * from dpa.assigned_request;"

Expected
--------
- if defaults request settings have been over ridden, they will be written to assigned_request table
- if defaults request settings are reused, the field in the assigned request table will be blank and the API will get data from request_default and request_options_default

Step4
=====
Ensure the agent has been reloaded and the sub-nodes are created on the tree

Expected
--------
sub-nodes are created on the tree
