Step1
=====
1) setup DPA server 6.1.0 GA
2) Run discovery of a host with Replication Anaylysis
3) Run discovery of a SE (w2k3sqlqa) with Clariion array
4) Start Test = should successful
5) Object should be created

Expected
--------
Host should be created

Step2
=====
Check node is created using Agentless connection configuration

1) REST 
URI = /dpa-api/nodes/{nodeid}/datacollectionpolicy/applicable-requests

2) SQL

"select f_id,f_agent_id,f_function,f_module,f_agent_type,f_credential_id from dpa.data_collection_request;"

3) check the frequency value of the nodes (to use in checking after upgrade)

Expected
--------
1) REST has :

 <agent type="None">

2) SQL has :

f_agent_type=None  and f_agent_id=(empty)

3) from REST in (1)

<frequency type="Period">
      <period>3600</period>
    </frequency>
  

Step3
=====

UI

Expected
--------
Object created has subtree (Components) :

Object Library > {Object discover} > Components 

Step4
=====

Upgrade to 6.1.1 latest

Expected
--------

Upgrade successfully and all DPA svc start-up successfully

Step5
=====

Check node configuration is fine (similar to Step 2, but different URI and SQL) nad number of agentless nodes is same

1) REST
URI = /dpa-api/nodes/{nodeid}/requests

2) SQL

"select * from dpa.request_assigned;"

3) check frequency value of the node and the value remain same with step 2

Expected
--------
1) REST has :

 <agent type="None">

2) SQL has :

f_agent_type=None  and f_agent_id=(empty)
  
3) from (1)

<frequency type="Period">
      <period>3600</period>
    </frequency>
  

Step6
=====

Make sure the requests is run

1) Wait about for 2-3 times of frequency value in Step 5 (3) 
2) check history tab for the nodes in UI
3) or from SQL = "select * from dpa.request_history;"

Expected
--------
Requests is running every frequency value
