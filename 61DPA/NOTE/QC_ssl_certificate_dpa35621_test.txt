1) Install and setup DPA server 6.1.1.GA
2) make a backup of apollo.keystore and standalone.xml files
Linux - /opt/emc/dpa/services/standalone/configuration/apollo.keystore & standalone.xml
Windows - C:\Program Files\EMC\dpa\services\standalone\configuration\apollo.keystore & standalone.xml
3) Run any REST request using https and make sure it display default server certificate setting as follow :

Example :

GET https://10.64.213.62:9002/dpa-api/license

* SSL connection using TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA
* Server certificate:
*       subject: CN=EMC Data Protection Advisor,OU=EMC Data Protection Advisor,O=EMC Data Protection Advisor,L=Unknown,ST=Unknown,C=Un...
*       start date: Jul 22 16:04:11 2013 GMT
*       expire date: Sep 11 16:04:11 2024 GMT
*       common name: EMC Data Protection Advisor
*       issuer: CN=EMC Data Protection Advisor,OU=EMC Data Protection Advisor,O=EMC Data Protection Advisor,L=Unknown,ST=Unknown,C=Un...
* Server auth using Basic with user 'administrator'

OR

Login to UI through browser and check the cetificate information :

Chrome
- click lock key symbol near your URL
- > Connection > Certificate information > Details > Issuer

Firefox
- click lock key symbol near your URL
- > More Information > View Certificate > Issued By

4) Create and import self-signed certificate
4.1) /opt/emc/dpa/services/_jre/bin/keytool -genkey -alias [youralias] -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -keystore /opt/emc/dpa/services/standalone/configuration/apollo.keystore

[youralias] = any alias (any name) as long as you use it consistently = rt-dpa2

4.2) keystore password = apollo
4.3) first and last name = server hostname (in full with domainname - `hostname -f`)
rt-dpa2.homebase.corp.com 

4.4) change standalone.xml's key-alias with [youralias]

original => key-alias="apollokey" name="ssl" password="apollo"
new => key-alias="rt-dpa2" name="ssl" password="apollo"

5) restart DPA service
6) Run any REST request using https and make sure it display new server certificate

Example :

GET https://10.64.213.62:9002/dpa-api/license

* SSL connection using TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA
* Server certificate:
*       subject: CN=rt-dpa2.homebase.corp.com,OU=DPA Horizon,O=EMC Computer Systems UK Ltd,L=Abingdon,ST=Oxfordshire,C=UK
*       start date: Aug 22 13:00:50 2014 GMT
*       expire date: Nov 20 13:00:50 2014 GMT
*       common name: rt-dpa2.homebase.corp.com
*       issuer: CN=rt-dpa2.homebase.corp.com,OU=DPA Horizon,O=EMC Computer Systems UK Ltd,L=Abingdon,ST=Oxfordshire,C=UK
* Server auth using Basic with user 'administrator'

7) make another backup of apollo.keystore and standalone.xml files (same as step 2)
8) Upgrade DPA server to latest 6.2.0
9) Run any REST request using https and make sure it display new server certificate

Example :

GET https://10.64.213.62:9002/dpa-api/license

* SSL connection using TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA
* Server certificate:
*       subject: CN=rt-dpa2.homebase.corp.com,OU=DPA Horizon,O=EMC Computer Systems UK Ltd,L=Abingdon,ST=Oxfordshire,C=UK
*       start date: Aug 22 13:00:50 2014 GMT
*       expire date: Nov 20 13:00:50 2014 GMT
*       common name: rt-dpa2.homebase.corp.com
*       issuer: CN=rt-dpa2.homebase.corp.com,OU=DPA Horizon,O=EMC Computer Systems UK Ltd,L=Abingdon,ST=Oxfordshire,C=UK
* Server auth using Basic with user 'administrator'

10) Extra tests

10.1) List of certificates in apollo.keystore have same entries (before and after upgrade)

keytool -list -keystore apollo.keystore

10.2) key-alias value in standalone.xml (before and after upgrade) are the value set in step 4.4

eg
key-alias="rt-dpa2" name="ssl" password="apollo"
