how to create Alerts?


14:32Bandarupally, Himabindu 
we need to create New or Assign Default Analysis Policy to the objects on which we need to generate Alerts 
Appy to the objects via Applied analaysis policies tab 
Advisor Section--> Alerts -> alerts with a new state will be generated to display we have applied the analysis on node so and so 
based on the rule specified in the analysis policy -alerts will be generated in alerts tab

example alert : when any backup job fails -backup failed alert will be generated 
for that you need to monitor any backup module and apply analysis policy to the backup module node 
try it out ask me if any questions
