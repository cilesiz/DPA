I.ve taken a look at the recover debug log and I suspect the issue is due to nsrexecd not being registered correctly with rpcbind on RedHat 6 due to the requirement to maintain compatibility with older versions of RedHat Linux.

Can you please try starting rpcbind in insecure mode on the NetWorker server and let me know if it makes a difference to the problem ?

To do this:

Create a file in /etc/sysconfig called rpcbind with the following contents:

RPCBIND_ARGS=-i

Restart rpcbind on the Linux system
Restart the NetWorker daemons

If this still doesn.t work then please collect a new copy of the recover debug output and have someone raise a bug with NetWorker engineering.

Regards

Mark

Thanks for letting me know.

If Scott and Michael are already aware then they should be able to deal with raising a bug for the problem.

It looks to me as if the authentication of the RPC connection on the NetWorker server to the different NetWorker processes is failing and I suspect it has something to do with rpcbind.

The messages from the previous log look to the issue being caused by nsrexecd not being bound to the localhost which is a requirement with RedHat rpcbind on 6.x whereas it could be bound to any of the addresses for the server with previous versions.

Regards

Mark

Hi Mark,

Sorry for late reply. I.m busy testing DPA at the moment. This is the recover_log.out file after set the RPCBIND_ARGS.
Jonathan has emailed Scott Bingham and Michael Kaufman about this problem.

Thanks,
