How to reset the administrator password for EMC Networker

AUGUST 2, 2013 BY JONATHAN FRAPPIER

If you ever find yourself without the administrator password for EMC Networker, you can use the steps below to reset the password to the default so you can log in.  This is also in support.emc.com, but I have a bit of trouble with the re-directs they do to SalesForce.com from time to time.

For a Linux OS, start a terminal session (hopefully you at least have that, maybe thats another blog post I should write)
If you did not log in as root (and hopefully you didn.t) type sudo -i to elevate your priviliges

Type the following

export GST_RESET_PW=1

Stop and start the GST services by typing

/etc/init.d/gst stop
/etc/init.d/gst start

Launch the mangement console
You should now be able to log in with the username administrator and default password of administrator

Change the password
Go back to your SSH session and type

export GST_RESET_PW

Hopefully that gets you logged in!  If your install is on Windows, check out this blog post:  http://geek-digest.blogspot.com/2013/03/how-to-reset-administrator-password-for.html
