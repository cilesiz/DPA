blank = take default value from DCP Default (usually DPA server itself)
None = agentless

f_overridden_agent_type will have remote /local based on what you give on discovery 
this overridden value will be set when there is any change to defaults while discovery 
This field is blank for DPA server Host 
for agentless it is None 

14:56Talib, Rosli
ok

14:57Bandarupally, Himabindu
do you see it blank other than dpa Host and postgres

14:58Talib, Rosli
yes
in Clariion

14:59Bandarupally, Himabindu
probably a bug
