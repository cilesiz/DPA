hi Mike


12:08Skilbeck, Michael
are you going to delete change default request options test cases.
?
so we have 3 per app and device


12:10Talib, Rosli
ok, I'll do that. that's in other story?


12:10Skilbeck, Michael
yes will be covered in DPA-31782
currently the discovery wizard doesn't respect the default requests at all. 
it overrides everything
why we didn't pick this up in DCP testing I don't know
we should have raised this.
but now shyam has left
anyway what is done is done
so must move on.


12:14Talib, Rosli
yeah. thanks
I pick up DPA-31794
is the secondary storage refer to protection storage?
I just guess


12:15Skilbeck, Michael
let us do that last
it is whatever it left after we have done the other tasks


12:16Talib, Rosli
ok, will unassign it
For me, I need to design QC testcases first
