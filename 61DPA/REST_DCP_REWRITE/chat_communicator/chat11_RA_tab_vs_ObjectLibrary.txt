hi Bindu

12:11Bandarupally, Himabindu
Hi Rosli

12:12Talib, Rosli
I'm testing DPA-32916
I can't see anything in RA tab

12:12Bandarupally, Himabindu
ok
did you assign the analysis policy ?
Assign the policy to the group on which you want to show the alerts 

12:15Talib, Rosli
can you give me the instructions on how to do that?

12:15Bandarupally, Himabindu
ok sure 
do you have DPA with any backup applications monitoring

12:16Talib, Rosli
I hv one with avamar

12:17Bandarupally, Himabindu
ok discover any networker like w2k3nw80 
so that we can have some alerts on backup jobs 

12:19Talib, Rosli
ok, I hv discovered w2k3nw80 to my centos

12:19Bandarupally, Himabindu
ok cool 
now from  Policies --> Analysis policy --> create policy or assign default policy to the group

12:23Talib, Rosli
how to assign policy to the group?

12:25Talib, Rosli
oh... is it under Applied Analysis Policies tab?

12:26Bandarupally, Himabindu
yes you can assign the default policy to agroup from applied policy tab 
apply/trun it ON
turn*

12:29Talib, Rosli
what will happened if at "Backup Server" I put "Default Analysis Policy", but it's subtree "EMC Networker" I put my own "test1policy" ?

12:31Bandarupally, Himabindu
netwoker will have direct assignation policy test1policy
the last assigned policy on EMC networker will be applied

12:32Talib, Rosli
oh
ok

12:32Bandarupally, Himabindu
but other nodes in "Backup Server" have default policy
you can verify that 

12:33Talib, Rosli
yeah

12:34Bandarupally, Himabindu
perfect
now when you apply the test1 policy 
to EMC networker
when any alerts on the backup servers will be displayed in the RA Tab tree

12:41Talib, Rosli
it didn't display anything... it just empty

12:41Bandarupally, Himabindu
ok run some failed jobs in networker 
and run the jobmonitor request on networker to pick the latest job data --DPA should give an alert on failed jobs 

15:55Talib, Rosli
after run some failed job, how to run job monitor request? 

15:56Bandarupally, Himabindu
go to networker application node and run the request from data collection tab 

15:56Talib, Rosli
ok, run the Networker Job monitor 

15:57Bandarupally, Himabindu
ok run bakup failed jobs report
you should see the failed job you ran

15:58Talib, Rosli
ok

15:59Bandarupally, Himabindu
then we will be sure that the DPA has latest job data 
and we can see the alerts section , it hsould have an alert 

15:59Talib, Rosli
yes, it has alert

16:00Bandarupally, Himabindu
and RA tab also shoud have refreshed the tree

16:02Talib, Rosli
is it refresh by itself?

16:04Bandarupally, Himabindu
yes 

16:05Talib, Rosli
ok, yeah
but how to get as Avia describe in DPA-32916... when open node props in RA tab - no DC requests are presented... what DC request did she talking about?

16:10Bandarupally, Himabindu
in the RA tab we have configuration tree same as inventory 
when we see properties on node we see the datacollection tab and requests assigned to it 
Avia was seeing empty data collection tab with no requests

18:05Talib, Rosli
so, mean that the issue has resolved. Because i can see propertie on node and data collection tab with requests

18:06Bandarupally, Himabindu
do you see the requests in RA tab 

18:08Talib, Rosli
yeah... under rhel55-networker - Host Status (11), Host Monitoring - Configuration (13) and Host Performance 
( 8 )

18:09Bandarupally, Himabindu
ok cool 

18:09Talib, Rosli
also recover Point

18:10Bandarupally, Himabindu
great gtry comparing the inventory-->node preperties  and RA Tab node properties
try*
if seems ok then issue has resolved 


18:14Talib, Rosli
rhel55-networker in Object Library > Hosts is exactly same with RA tab's rhel55-networker

18:14Bandarupally, Himabindu
ok thats it 

18:15Talib, Rosli
ok, thanks alot Bindu

18:16Bandarupally, Himabindu
np Rosli
