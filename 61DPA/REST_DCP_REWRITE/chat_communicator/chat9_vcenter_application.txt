I hv problem with DPA-32678
look like the application not showing 


17:04Skilbeck, Michael

ok
you need to wait two mins
can you share screen


17:04Talib, Rosli

oh...


17:04Skilbeck, Michael

and go to object properties


17:05Talib, Rosli

let me check it again


17:05Skilbeck, Michael

and request history
I would like to show you
how to check if the request has run or not
when it runs it tells you whether applications are autocreated
and then you can check if request has been assigned to application

hi Mike
the Applications till didn't show Networker
*still


17:14Skilbeck, Michael

application discovery is only for oracle, exchange and sql server


17:14Talib, Rosli

oh


17:14Skilbeck, Michael

don't think we auto discover networker



17:15Talib, Rosli

sorry, I don't know that


17:15Skilbeck, Michael

so you can discovery seri with wysdm credentials for sql server
we don't have exchange in our lab


17:16Talib, Rosli

yeah... so I can use dpa-vcenter with seri as virtual hosts


17:16Skilbeck, Michael

and oracle is often problematic


17:16Talib, Rosli

right
ok
