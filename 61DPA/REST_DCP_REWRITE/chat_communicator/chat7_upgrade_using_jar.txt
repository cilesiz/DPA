how to install using jar? Last time Ruth has taught me, but I forgot

take a copy of you dpa.ear, ui.war and apollo.war from your applications folder under server
then stop your application server
then replace ears and war file
then restart server
sometimes it is cleaner to drop cascaded the dbs apollo,dpa and dpara
and rarely you may also want to delete data and tmp directories under standalone directory
but not for this
however may be good to drop the dbs so you can rediscrover all your hosts

victor has fixed host discovery issue
so maybe better to continue tomorrow morning when we get jars for that
we don't want to burn out

is it still a jar or installer build?

23:16Skilbeck, Michael

yes
you install build using installer
then copy in new jars
and restart server
server build is still broken
so no changes getting into
