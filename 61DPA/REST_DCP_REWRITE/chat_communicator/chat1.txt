hi Mike


10:14Skilbeck, Michael
Hi


10:14Talib, Rosli
is the 611-DCP installer available from uncle?


10:18Skilbeck, Michael
no
alex still needs to set it up
he will email us when ready


10:19Talib, Rosli
ok


10:25Talib, Rosli
for time being, should I pick up any testing available under Other Issues?


10:25Skilbeck, Michael
yes please


10:25Talib, Rosli
ok


10:26Skilbeck, Michael
try the running requests in default ones
right mouse click on run button from node properties
and select run in debug
and gather historic data


10:28Talib, Rosli
6.2?


10:29Skilbeck, Michael
yes
you can use install on w2k8x64auto
bindu installed this morning


10:29Talib, Rosli
ok, will do that


10:30Skilbeck, Michael
the initial issue is whether we can run recoverpoint perf cs in debug
and gather historic data
also the date in the agent wasn't being set correctly so we never got data back for all apps
for eg avamar


10:32Talib, Rosli
about recover point, yesterday I setup my own RP simulator and successfully discovered


10:32Skilbeck, Michael
so when you run in debug the agent files get save to the modtest dir


10:32Talib, Rosli
but I don't know wheter it's ok or not (I don't hv much experience on it)


10:32Skilbeck, Michael
and when you gather historic data the data should be sent to listener and end up in db
initially configure avamar and run historic data for big date range
see if lots of jobs are in modtest
then gathere historic data for jobmonitor request
jobs should be in db
